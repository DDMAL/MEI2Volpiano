# Skeleton Process
# 1. Get the MEI file into the script 
# 2. Parse until the `body` section is reached 
# 3. Parse each `sylabble` tag and put the words and neuemes in pairs (dict)
# 4. Match the words and the neumes at the end of the body loop
# 5. Convert output dict into string and export
# Process is one pass with O(x) for x = length of lines in body. Roughly
